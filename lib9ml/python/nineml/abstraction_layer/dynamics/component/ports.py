    """ Base class for |AnalogSendPort|, |AnalogReceivePort|, |EventSendPort|,
    |EventReceivePort| and |AnalogReducePort|.

    In general, a port has a ``name``, which can be used to reference it,
    and a ``mode``, which specifies whether it sends or receives information.

    Generally, a send port can be connected to receive port to allow different
    components to communicate.

    |AnalogSendPort| and |EventSendPort|s can be connected to any number of
    |AnalogReceivePort| and |EventReceivePort|s respectively, but each
    |AnalogReceivePort| and |EventReceivePort| can only be connected to a
    single |AnalogSendPort| and |EventSendPort| respectively. port. In order to
    collect analog inputs from several |AnalogSendPort|s into a single port, we
    use a |AnalogReducePort|. An |AnalogReducePort| port requires an additional
    parameter, ``reduce_op``, which specifies how to combine the information
    from the ports, for example, by adding their values together, `+`.

    For example, if we had several Hodgkin-Huxley channels on a neuron, we
    would want each one to have a |AnalogSendPort|, ``i`` containing the
    current passing through that type of channel. Then, we would have a single
    |AnalogReducePort|, ``I_in`` for example, with ``op='+'``, which would
    combine them together to calculate the voltage change in the neuron.
