Getting started
===============

To install the Python API for NineML, see installation.txt.

The easiest way to get started is probably to look at the examples
(in the lib9ml/python/examples subdirectory). Running the examples
will produce an XML file, e.g.::

    $ cd lib9ml/python/examples/UL
    $ python simple_example.py
    
will create "simple_example.xml" in the same directory.

After that, you may wish to work through the user layer tutorial in user_layer_tutorial.txt
and the abstraction layer tutorial in abstraction_layer_tutorial.txt.
