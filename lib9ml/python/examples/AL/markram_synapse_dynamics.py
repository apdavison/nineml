Dynamic synaptic weight implementing phenomenological short term
depression and facilitation.

  Description:
  
   Implemented is the ODE form of the short-term depression and
   facilitation model as described Eq (2) and Eq (3) in [1] or Eq (6)
   in [2], whereby Eq (2) in [1] seems to have an error in the
   subscript of u_{n+1}.  It should be u_{n}.

   The model corresponds to the markram_synapse in NEST, which is a
   simplification of the NEST tsodyks_synapse (synaptic time course is
   neglected).
