# Case study:
# Inhomogeneous Gamma Renewal Process

# This is NOT valid 9ML

# Problems:
# - gamma_hazard
# - exp_rand
# - rand
# Implementation conformence:
# - Transitions are simulataneous if their conditions can be simultaneously true.
# - If the Regime solver has a timestep of dt, then transitions on the time-scale of dt are treated as simulteneous.
# - all Regime Transition conditions _must_ be evaluated before running any transition nodes
# - When Simultaneous transitions occur, the order of execution of each
#   simulataneous transition's do=[] code is not specifiable, i.e. the user
#   should take care that the order does not matter.  Only one transition can
#   transition, and the transition happens after all do=[] code is
#   executed.
